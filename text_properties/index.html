    <h1>Monk seal</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Monk seals are earless seals of the tribe <a href="#nowhere">Monachini.</a> They are the only earless seals
        found in tropical climates. The two genera of monk seals, Monachus and Neomonachus,
        comprise three species: the Mediterranean monk seal, Monachus monachus; the Hawaiian monk seal,
        Neomonachus schauinslandi; and the Caribbean monk seal, Neomonachus tropicalis,
        which became extinct in the 20th century. The two surviving species are now rare and in
        imminent danger of extinction. All three monk seal species were classified in genus
        Monachus until 2014, when the Caribbean and Hawaiian species were placed into a new genus,
        Neomonachus.
    <p>
        Monk seals have a slender body and are agile. They have a broad, flat snout with nostrils on
        the top. Monk seals are polygynous, and group together in harems. They feed mainly on bony
        fish and cephalopods, but they are opportunistic. The skin is covered in small hairs,
        which are generally black in males and brown or dark gray in females. Monk seals are found
        in the Hawaiian archipelago, certain areas in the east Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea
        (such as Cabo Blanco and Gyaros island), and formerly in the tropical areas of the west
        Atlantic Ocean.

    <h2>Habitat</h2>

    <p>
        The Hawaiian monk seal, as the name suggests, lives solely in the Hawaiian archipelago.
        Monk seals migrated to Hawaii between 4â€“11 Mya through an open-water passage between
        North and South America called the Central American Seaway. The Isthmus of Panama
        closed the seaway 3 Mya. The species may have evolved in the Pacific or Atlantic,
        but in either case, came to Hawaii long before the first Polynesians.[13] When
        monk seals are not hunting or eating, they generally bask on the beaches; Hawaiian
        monk seals tend to bask on sandy beaches and volcanic rock of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands.[14]
